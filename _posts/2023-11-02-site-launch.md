Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Thanks in large part to this great [tutorial](https://dfederm.com/creating-a-blog-using-github-pages/). As time goes on I'll be adding more and fixing the issues I can see already.
